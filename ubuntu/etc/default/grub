# /etc/default/grub

# This file controls the operation of ‘grub-mkconfig’.
# It is sourced by a shell script, and so must be valid POSIX shell input;
#     normally, it will just be a sequence of ‘KEY=value’ lines,
#     but if the value contains spaces or other special characters then
#         it must be quoted.

# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.
# Also possible directly: `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:
#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'
